# vstemplate-webapi-clean-architecture
Microsoft .NET Core WebApi - a Visual Studio Template that generates basic scaffolding for small to mid-sized projects

I find myself doing a lot of innovation work, creating small proof-of-concepts and spinning up apps and services at a moderately fast rate. 
This can get really frustrating if you want to implement services using Clean Architecure. Writing a webservice that has four endpoints, and yet spending most of your time creating folders and interfaces. :) There's always the option of writing throw-away code, but many of our POCs live(d) on for months - even years - and that "throw-away" code became part of the enterprise. Icky.

Never having created Visual Studio templates before, decided to give it the ol' college try, and see if this helped minimize startup friction.
